# Auto network speed test

This application is intended for use by Sonic internet installers to automatically do network tests, and to have photos of those tests sent to them via discord or email.


## Getting Started
I do not currently have instructions for self hosting the backend of this application written out. If you would like to use this application you may build or run the client file or reach out to me directly and I can send you a build + config file which will have your credentials for the backend
